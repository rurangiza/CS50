# What is CS50?
It's an introductory course on computer science by Harvard. It is accessible online and also on campus. I started it because I wanted a more hands on approach to learning programming. Because most online courses I took had no exercices to do on your own while you're learning the material. I would rather learn by implementing small features and know that I can do that on my own than follow along to create a big exciting app that I couldn't do by myself.
On this repo, I will share my learning, struggles and insights.
